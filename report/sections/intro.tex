\section{Introduction}
In this lab, we worked on the position control of an exoskeleton joint. The main goal was to see if the motor could accurately follow a specific movement path, known as a trajectory.

First, we wrote a script to generate a reference signal (a sine wave) to tell the exoskeleton where to move. We then recorded how the actual device responded to see if there was any delay or error. Finally, we performed a system identification test. By sending sine waves at different speeds (frequencies) to the motor, we could build a Bode plot and figure out the system's bandwidth—basically, how fast it can move before it starts lagging too much.
